# Perspective
A mod that allows you to rotate the camera around your player without actually rotating your entity.
Adapted from Lunar Client, this mod lets you toggle and hold!

This mod is a fork of [Celibistrial's code (freelook-fabric)](https://github.com/Celibistrial/freelook). This mod aims to use cloth-config instead of its own configuration screen for a nicer screen.
